Description: reverse code engineering GUI for pyew and radare
 Bokken is a GUI for pyew, the malware analysis tool, and radare2, the reverse
 engineering framework.  Bokken is also the RCE tool for the Inguma project.
 .
 Actually Bokken supports the following formats:
  - PE
  - ELF
  - Java (.class)
  - Web
  - PDF
 .
 Most of this functionality comes from either pyew or radare2, so it offers
 almost all the features that pyew has and some of radare's.  It's intended to
 be used as a basic disassembler, mainly, to analyze malware and
 vulnerabilities.
 .
 Currently Bokken is neither an hexadecimal editor nor a full featured
 disassembler YET, so it should not be used for deep code analysis or to try to
 modify files with it.
